      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          SEDS BPHC was founded in April 2019 by a group of students with a
          burning passion for aerospace. Today the club has proudly grown into
          an 80+ member strong team. The club started out by competing in the
          Spaceport America Cup, and has since expanded to cubesats, cansats,
          rocket motors and thrust vector control projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team is an amalgamation of undergraduate students from almost all
          fields of engineering and science in our college. Mechanical
          Engineering, Computer Science, Biology, Electronics and Communication
          Engineering, Physics are to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          This season, we aim to launch our first rocket on-site at the
          Spaceport America Cup 2022 and participate in the Cansat Competition
          organized by the American Astronautical Society. We are also designing
          two CubeSats which we plan to launch in the near future.Our newly
          established R&D division is testing solid rocket motors and intends to
          work with hybrid motors soon. Thrust Vector Control is also an area of
          research for the team.

        <h2>SA Cup</h2>
        <p>
          SEDS BPHC made its debut in this prestigious competition in 2021.
          Among the four BITS Pilani campuses, weâ€™re the first & only one to
          participate in the SA Cup. We are also one of the only 6 teams
          representing India among the 153 international teams participating in
          the competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our category, the goal is to build a rocket 8 feet long, weighing
          approximately 28kg, which flies upto 10,000 feet and uses
          Commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) solid rocket motors.
